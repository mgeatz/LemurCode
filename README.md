# Welcome to lemur code
LemurCode (lemur, lemur-p, and lemur-n) "allows any CSS permutation of padding and margin,"<sup>[1]</sup> up to 100px/-100px. Simply add a defined class from LemurCode to your HTML tag's class attribute and away you GO! You'll be adding margin and padding indiscriminately in no time. "AND it's minified, so you know it's good."<sup>[1]</sup>
