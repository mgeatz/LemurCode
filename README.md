# Welcome to lemur code
LemurCode (lemur, lemur-p, and lemur-n) "allows any CSS permutation of padding and margin,"<sup>[1]</sup> up to 100px/-100px. Simply add a defined class from LemurCode to your HTML tag's class attribute and away you GO! You'll be adding margin and padding indiscriminately in no time. "AND it's minified, so you know it's good."<sup>[1]</sup>
<br><br>
With LemurCode you can make bad business requests a reality; you can give content authors the power they've been looking for; and, you never have to worry about inline styles (at least for margin and padding).
